VANCOUVER--  GM Mak has done another big trade this season sending 2 of top Rangers to GM Ku for Buffalo's streaking Tage Thompson and Carlson. 

Analysis show this trade is quite fair for both teams as Mak is looking for scoring and Ku is looking for goalie stats. Big names have to be paid in order to acquire such players. Thompson is on a heater scoring at a 125 point pace. Does Ku lose out on scoring if this trade goes through? Mak loses out on some important goalie stats. The wire is dry and there aren't many options if any. How will he survive the goalie desert?
