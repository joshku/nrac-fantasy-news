VANCOUVER--  GM Josh Ku believes in change early in the season. He trades Kane, Batherson, and Kopitar to GM Ricky Tam and GM Hannes Kan. The trade comes in at a surprising time as many teams are still trying to settle down. Teams that were involved had their needs addressed with the trades that happened tonight. Let's take a look at the in-depth analysis of the trades that took place. 

Ricky trade Malkin, Gudas, and Skinner for Josh's Kane

Going into the season, Ricky loved Evander Kane. In order to acquire the player he overpayed with a three for one trade. The trade covers the loss of G, SOG, PP, and HITS that Kane previously covered for GM Josh Ku. Interesting note Malkin has not played a single game for Ricky's team yet. Malkin was previously acquired from GM Clifford Mak in a deal involving Top defenceman and Goalies. 

Josh trade Batherson and Kopitar for Hannes' Fox and Forsberg

Due to the trade above Josh is forced to drop two players. However, the two players he dropped are waiver wire fodder so it made no difference to him. However, he still needed to address his scoring and goalie needs. Hannes has an abundance in Goalies after the waiver pick up of Blackwood and is willing to part ways with a goalie to build depth as a his team was devastated by the auto draft. Goalies are a rare commodity in the league as there are ZERO starters left on the wire. Now GM Josh Ku has 3 top 4 round deencemen and a solid Goalie core. Meanwhile Hannes addresses his needs for hits and scoring with multi cat player Batherson and more Centre depth in Kopitar. 

Hannes trade Thomas for Ricky's Smith

To complete the three way trade, Hannes sends Rob Thomas to Ricky for Reilly Smith. Hannes has too many centers and cannot fit them all on his team. With an abundance of playmaking centers he trades Thomas for a scoring winger playing with Jack Eichel.
